# RESTAURANT CHATBOT 

## A fully functional chatbot written in javascript designed to take your orders, respond and store them 

An interface is designed in a user friendly chat style for users choose from a list of commands and get response accordingly. The menu is as listed below:

Select 1 to Place an order
Select 99 to checkout order
Select 98 to see order history
Select 97 to see current order
Select 0 to cancel order
 
* Place an order (1):
   A list of food items currently available is displayed to the user to select from. After selecting a food item, the main menu is returned back as well as a confirmation that the last order was received. A user may then decide to choose another item if he/she wishes to.

* Checkout an order (99): 
   When a user enters this option the food(s) selected from the above is confirmed for checkout. A confirmation is sent back to the user that the process was successful and the items checked out are stored in the user checkout history database. The main menu is also returned in case the user wants to perform any more operations.

* See order history (98): 
   When selected, a list of all checked out orders is returned and displayed to the user. This does not include orders that have not been checked out.
   

* See current order (97):
   While placing orders, they are stored temporarily so that users can see their current orders. This option returns the current order that hasn't been checkedout yet.

* Cancel order (0):
   This option clears the current order memory thereby removing all orders that haven't been checked out.
